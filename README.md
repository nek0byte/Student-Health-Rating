## Overview
This project leverages IBM Granite to classify and summarize data on the impact of mobile phone usage on student health. By analyzing a dataset containing students' mobile phone habits and self-reported health ratings, the project aims to uncover insights into how digital behaviors affect well-being. The analysis includes data preprocessing, health rating predictions using Granite, and revealing key correlations between excessive phone usage and health outcomes.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Features:**  
  - Demographics: Gender, Age  
  - Lifestyle: Sleep Time, Screen Time, Physical Activity, Breakfast Habit  
  - Mental Health: Depression, Anxiety  
  - Outcome: GPA

## 🔍Results and Insights

- Key Insight: A strong negative correlation was found between excessive daily phone usage (>6 hours) and lower health ratings. Students who reported high usage were more likely to experience symptoms like sleep disturbances and eye strain, leading to poorer health ratings.
- Implications:
  - Educational institutions should consider implementing digital wellness programs to promote balanced technology use.
  - Awareness campaigns can help students and parents understand the health risks of excessive phone usage.
  - Further research could explore specific health dimensions (e.g., mental health, physical activity) affected by digital habits.
